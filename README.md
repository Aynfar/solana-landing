Test task <br>
I have completed the landing page and made it responsive up to the 992-pixel breakpoint. Please note that I don't have editing access to the Figma file, which is why some images may have lower quality. Please disregard that. Thank you. <br>
I have uploaded the file in zip format please download and review.
